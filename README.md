You want to use low-level training and evaluation loops and donâ€™t want to miss the convenience of the Keras callbacks? No problem! In this tutorial, we will implement a Keras callback in a low-level training and evaluation loop. For this article, I assume that you are familiar with the basic terminology and principles of Machine Learning and have done some toy examples with Keras.
HINT: When I first got in touch with Tensorflow and Keras, I was overwhelmed with the different terminology of Machine Learning and was happy that I found the Machine Learning Glossary by Google.
With a callback, it is possible to perform different actions at several stages while training your deep neural network. By default, Keras provides easy and convenient built-in callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau (Reduce learning Rate on Plateau) or EarlyStopping for your training and evaluation loop. Their usage is covered in the .fit() method of a model and can be passed as a list of callbacks:
